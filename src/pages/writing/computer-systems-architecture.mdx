This really is more of an exercise into whether I've understood the low level underpinnings of modern computer systems. This is the first part of a series in which I will cover architecture,
operating systems, networking and other fun stuff!

```jsx
const Counter = ({ name }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count + 1);
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This is the basic program whose timeline we're going to follow through this post.
