I think there is nothing harder than knowing when to stop. Truly.

Over the past couple of months, I have redesigned and created about 3-4 versions of this website. Every couple of weeks as soon as I'm finishing the website I get restless and start trolling the internet for more inspiration, a better design,
a more interesting animation, treating the entirety of the site as a blank canvas like something from [Awwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/).

_And honestly, it's really tiring._ Personal webpages are supposed to be where you collect, preserve and grow your thoughts.

Which is why I've decided to start with something completely minimal this time. I've taken inspiration from a couple of places, specifically, [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me/), [Chester How](https://chester.how/). I've also stolen this neat noise background material idea from arguably one of the most gorgeous blogs on the internet for Computer Science, [Nanda Syahrasyad's](https://www.nan.fyi/). Highly reccomend checking it out, really amazing design and content.

This is my attempt at reclaiming my space and calm on the internet back, and hopefully for a while this time. I will still attempt to create crazy cool, innovative things, pushing the boundaries of the way we interact with the web, but for now, this is my quiet place.

As it should be.

I will do my best to post more often now that I'm done with exams and university. I will be writing about Computer Science, learning to handle my relationships with more care, and anything I read about (_i.e, anything at all_&nbsp;). I'll also be writing about anything interesting I'm working on.

Like my thesis. Holy crap I have a lot to do. I should probably go work on it.

Until next time.

PS. Just to circle back to my original point (I'm a big believer of closed loops), see that first little horizontal line there on the page? That was where I originally intended to stop writing.
